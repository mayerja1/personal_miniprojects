# personal_miniprojects
In this repository you can find some of my personal programs that don't deserve their own repo.

So far there is:
1) `maze` - generate random mazes, solve them and render as a picture
2) `csp` - primitive csp solver
2) `dfa` - deterministic finite automaton simulator
3) `snake` - snake game with simple greedy AI
